# Troubleshooting

## Debug Mode

Pass `--debug` to enable verbose logging:

```bash
npx -y mirroir-mcp --debug
```

Logs are written to both stderr and `~/.mirroir-mcp/debug.log`. Logged events include permission checks, tap coordinates, focus state, and window geometry. With `--debug` active, the existing log is preserved across restarts (a `--- restart <time> ---` separator is appended) so prior-session diagnostics survive. Without `--debug`, the log is truncated in place on each startup.

Even without `--debug`, the server always writes startup information to `~/.mirroir-mcp/debug.log` — permission mode, denied tools, and hidden tools. Check this file first when debugging permission issues.

Tail the log in a separate terminal:

```bash
tail -f ~/.mirroir-mcp/debug.log
```

Combine with permission bypass for full-access debugging:

```bash
npx -y mirroir-mcp --debug --yolo
```

`--yolo` is an alias for `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; either flag bypasses the permission policy.

## Modifier State Corruption (Alternating Caps)

If you see alternating uppercase/lowercase when typing through iPhone Mirroring (e.g., "LiKe ThIs"), this is a known Apple bug with modifier state tracking in the iPhone Mirroring compositor.

**Workarounds:** Toggle Caps Lock, disconnect and reconnect iPhone Mirroring, or reboot the Mac. See [Apple Community thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254551671).

## Doctor

Run `mirroir doctor` to check all prerequisites at once. Each failed check includes a fix hint:

```bash
mirroir doctor
```

Use `--json` for machine-readable output or `--no-color` to disable ANSI colors.

## Development Watch Mode

During development, use `mirroir-watch.sh` to automatically rebuild and restart the server when source files change:

```bash
./mirroir-watch.sh --debug --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

The script uses `fswatch` to monitor `Sources/` for `.swift` file changes, rebuilds via `swift build`, and restarts the server process. Install fswatch with `brew install fswatch` if needed. The MCP client will need to reconnect after each restart.

## Common Issues

**Typing goes to the wrong app instead of iPhone** — The MCP server activates iPhone Mirroring via AppleScript before every input call. If keystrokes still land in the wrong app, check that your terminal has Accessibility permissions in System Settings. Note that focus stealing is expected — see [limitations](limitations.md#focus-stealing).

**Taps work, but text does not reach the iPhone** — Try typing into the same focused field with the Mac's physical keyboard. If that also produces no characters, quit and reopen iPhone Mirroring, then retry. This restored input in one observed mirroring session; the symptom can have other causes.

**Taps don't register** — Run `mirroir doctor` to check prerequisites. Verify that iPhone Mirroring is connected (not showing "Connect to your iPhone" screen) and that Accessibility permissions are granted in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility.

**"Mirroring paused" screenshots** — The MCP server auto-resumes paused sessions. If it persists, click the iPhone Mirroring window manually once.

**iOS autocorrect mangling typed text** — iOS applies autocorrect to typed text. Disable autocorrect in iPhone Settings > General > Keyboard, or type words followed by spaces to confirm them before autocorrect triggers.

**YOLO model not loading** — Check `~/.mirroir-mcp/debug.log` for startup messages. The server logs whether it found a model (`OCR: auto-detected YOLO model, using Vision + YOLO`) or not (`OCR: no YOLO model found`). Verify the `.mlmodelc` directory exists in `~/.mirroir-mcp/models/` and is a valid compiled CoreML model. You can also set `yoloModelPath` in `settings.json` to point to a specific path.

**AI vision mode not activating** — Check `~/.mirroir-mcp/debug.log` for the agent-transport startup line. `Agent transport: embedded (Rust FFI)` means the embedded embacle runtime is linked and active; `Agent transport: HTTP` means the embacle FFI is not linked into this binary. If it falls back to HTTP, verify that `embacle-ffi` is installed (`brew list embacle-ffi`) and rebuild from source (`swift build -c release`) — the FFI library (`libembacle.a`) must be linked at compile time. If linked but vision requests fail, check that your CLI agent (GitHub Copilot or Claude Code) is authenticated. Set `"screenDescriberMode": "ocr"` in `settings.json` to force local OCR as a fallback. (`agentTransport: "http"` in `settings.json` also forces HTTP even when the FFI is linked.)

**Compiled skill fails but you don't know why** — Use `--agent` to diagnose failures. Deterministic OCR analysis runs first (free, no API key), then optionally sends context to an AI for richer root-cause analysis:
```bash
mirroir test --agent skill.yaml                    # deterministic OCR diagnosis (YAML or SKILL.md)
mirroir test --agent claude-sonnet-4-6 skill.yaml  # deterministic + AI diagnosis
```
See the [AI-Assisted Diagnosis](../README.md#ai-assisted-diagnosis) section for all supported providers and custom agent configuration.
